# Path Planning

The goal of this project is to navigate a virtual highway. We are provided the car's localization information on the map and simulated sensor information about the other cars on the highway. Our task is to follow closely but not exceed the highway's speed limit, while avoiding collisions with other cars. Our planner will also have the ability to change lanes to get around slower-moving traffic. We are provided a map of waypoints identifying the path of the highway in the environment.

In this and previous terms, we have studied many different ways to create trajectories given sparse waypoints. We created a simple [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) and a more sophisticated [model predictive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control) system in past projects. We also studied a [minimum jerk trajectory](http://www.shadmehrlab.org/book/minimum_jerk/minimumjerk.htm), a strategy of fitting a fifth-order polynomial to sparse waypoints, minimizing the rate of change of acceleration, a measure of smoothness and comfort in an autonomous vehicle's trajectory.

In addition to creating a smooth trajectory between sparse waypoints, we also studied strategies to search for the optimal path between a start and end location, including hybrid A*, a treatment of the [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) optimal for physical-world robotics vehicles. We also studied higher-level strategies to choose optimal paths for environmental constraints (using e.g. [state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) and optimizing cost functions).

There are many different strategies and approaches one could utilize in this project. Following Udacity's [project walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sI3VHFPP0w), I opted to use [splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) for smooth trajectory generation, and simple logic for high-level behavior control.

Our car travels in a forward direction, gradually increasing its speed to the reference velocity (~50 mph). Using a [Frenet frame](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224156269_Optimal_Trajectory_Generation_for_Dynamic_Street_Scenarios_in_a_Frenet_Frame), we check for vehicles ahead that we might collide with. If a vehicle is found, we attempt a lane change (if the lane is unobstructed), preferring changing lanes to the left. If the target lane is obstructed, we simply lower our velocity to avoid a collision.

This simple implementation creates an agent that travels the highway in a pretty reasonable way, changing lanes to overtake slower vehicles if necessary. There are many ways this model could be improved, especially using a cost function to find an optimal goal-based trajectory. Using a state machine would allow for higher-level descriptions of intended behaviors. For example, our agent has no notion of "following" a vehicle in front, leading to the somewhat awkward behavior of a cycle of slowing (to avoid a collision with a car ahead), speeding up, slowing, speeding up, ad infinitum (if no lane openings appear). Fixing this is an obvious improvement.
